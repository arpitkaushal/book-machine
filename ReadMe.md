This is a webapp that we wish to use to book equipments from Lab in our college, or book rooms. 

Run the website - 
1. You'll need to run this on a localhost. 
2. For example - 
	a. I am using Wamp Server. So, I have copied the entire project to C:\wamp64\www
	b. Now, go to the URL "localhost\Booking-Machine\index.php"
	c. The site should appear in your Wamp Server confirgured browser.
